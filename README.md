# Asmuth
A C# library for manipulating concepts of the x86-64 architecture, and eventually disassemble its machine code.

This project has grown out of my interest for the x86-64 architecture. The main objective is nothing more than to formalize the concepts in my mind by coding them up, but in so doing some utility programs may come out of it (disassembler? debugger? who knows!).
